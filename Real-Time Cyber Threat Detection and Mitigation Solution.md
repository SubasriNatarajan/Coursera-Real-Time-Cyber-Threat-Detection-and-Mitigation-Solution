Question 1
The malicious client is sending a massive flood of SYN packets to the web server. Which of the following security mitigations choices (or none) is best for the web server administrator to employ to reduce the risk of this attack:
- None of the above

Question 2
The malicious client is sniffing packets on the local LAN to detect any local activity of interest. Which of the following security mitigations would be best for the administrator of the local LAN to employ to reduce the risk of the malicious client inappropriately obtaining information from other LAN users:
- Warnings to users to be careful

Question 3
